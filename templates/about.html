    <h5>About me</h5>
    <p>Hi! I'm a software engineer. Although I've got experience
    with different programming languages and technologies, I would
    say I'm more familiar with Python and C than any others.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to see some bits of code I've written, you might
    want to checkout my <a href="https://github.com/drimer">profile in
    Github</a>! I try to be active by providing things I've developed
    to the open source community, though it's hard to find the time
    to do so.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to know more about my professional career, you
    can take a peek at <a href="static/files/CV.pdf">my CV</a>.</p>
