    <h5>My background</h5>
    <p>I started with computing at university. Fortunately, I chose to study Computer Science in the university of Granada (Spain), and that led me where I am right now, constantly learning about new things.</p>
    <p>During my years at university, I volunteered at a Spanish government institution called Cruz Roja, bringing technology to people who couldn't manage to learn by themselfes due to disabilities, age, or any other reasons. Moreover, in my search for new fields in programming, I took online courses, such as Artifitial Intelligence at the university of Stamford.</p>
    <p>After learning all that university could teach me, I went on a trip to London in hopes of finding new challenges, projects to work on and people to learn from.</p>
