    <h5>About me</h5>
    <p>Hi! I'm a software developer. Although I've got experience
    with different programming languages and technologies, I would
    say I'm more familiar with Python and C than any others.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to see some bits of code I've written, you might
    want to checkout my <a href="https://github.com/drimer">profile in
    Github</a>! I try to be active by providing things I've developed
    to the open source community, though it's hard to find the time
    to do so.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to know more about my professional career, you
    can take a peek at my <a href="files/CV.pdf">CV</a>.</p>

    <h5>My background</h5>
    <p>I started writing software at university. Fortunately, I chose
    to study Computer Science in the university of Granada (Spain),
    and that led me where I am right now, and still constantly learning about new things.</p>
    <p>During my years at university, I volunteered at a Spanish government institution called Cruz Roja, bringing technology to people who couldn't manage to learn by themselfes due to disabilities, age, or any other reasons. Moreover, in my search for new fields in programming, I took online courses, such as Artifitial Intelligence at the university of Stamford.</p>
    <p>After learning all that university could teach me, I took my
    next step by moving to London in hopes of finding new challenges, projects to work on and people to learn from.</p>
